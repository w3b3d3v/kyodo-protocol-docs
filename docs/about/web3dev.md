# About WEB3DEV

WEB3DEV is a pioneering community-centric business offering innovative educational opportunities and a revolutionary blockchain payment system. This system validates work and rewards developers with W3D tokens, bestowing a range of benefits while they deliver their expertise for their respective employers. 

Notably, it is also the birthplace of the Kyōdō Protocol.

## Community

The Community is a focal point for WEB3DEV, with our DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) subdivided into sub-DAOs according to local languages and cultures. This structure facilitates easy engagement, fostering a sense of connection and making learning more accessible. To date, we have successfully launched communities for both Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish speakers.

## Education

As the largest web3 programming school in Brazil, we offer a robust selection of eight courses covering a broad spectrum of topics, including DAO in JavaScript, Smart Contract in Solidity, and NFT Game and Collection on Solana. Having already completed 22 batches and educated more than 7,000 students, we remain committed to shaping the future of web3 development.

## Business

The ultimate goal of our business model is to connect qualified individuals with companies in need of software development or content creation. To that end, we provide a crypto-based payment system, backed by a protocol that grants developers DAO ownership tokens, exclusive benefits, and a blockchain-based Proof of Resume upon hire.
