# Protocol Overview

# Who should use Kyōdō?

Kyōdō was designed to be used by any community that brings together professionals from the same field of expertise. While it needs to be implemented within a community, the greatest benefit is generated for professionals who choose to receive their compensation through the protocol. Professionals who recognize the value of using the protocol can suggest to the community administrators they favor to start using the protocol.

The adoption of the protocol by a professional community empowers its members and strengthens their position, much like cooperatives operate in the market.

# How do Kyōdō differ from other options?

Some other protocols, such as [Proof-of-Talent](https://proofoftalent.org/), attempt to generate an experience index based on various factors such as activities, completed courses, project contributions, recommendations, etc. As the creators of Kyōdō, we believe that combining multiple forms of evaluating a person's expertise creates a weak index with little relevance, difficult comparability, and high susceptibility to fraud. Comparing different forms of evaluating knowledge in a single index is like comparing apples and oranges.

We believe that using a single factor to assess a person's experience is the most effective way to create a ranking and determine who has the most experience within a list of candidates.

The Kyōdō Protocol is based on the financial amount a person has earned while working with a particular skill.

If someone can charge a high value for their hourly work and earns a substantial amount in just one month, they likely have much more experience than someone who can charge a lower value.

If someone charges a lower value for their hourly work but has worked many hours with a specific skill, they undoubtedly have a considerable amount of experience.

The total amount of money received, related to the required skill, is the best way to measure a person's experience.

# Limitations

Considering that a person's experience is solely based on the relationship between the number of hours worked with a specific skill and the received compensation is too simplistic.

Certainly, there are individuals who have never been hired to work with a particular technology, for example, but are highly skilled and possess extensive knowledge. A prime example is software developers who contribute to open-source projects.

While there are many cases of individuals with significant expertise without being hired for on-demand work at a specific salary, the Kyōdō Protocol does not concern itself with addressing these cases. Generally, these individuals are not actively seeking employment (precisely because they lack that track record) and do not fit the profile of protocol users. They are typically researchers, entrepreneurs, and creators who are not seeking recognition for work done for others, and the likelihood of these individuals actually using the protocol is low.

We do not aim to solve all the world's problems. Our focus is on providing an intelligent and effective option for a portion of professionals, typically those seeking projects and jobs with reputable employers.
