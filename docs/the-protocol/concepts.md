# Concepts

## Protocol
This refers to a set of software running in a decentralized manner, operating through smart contracts on supported networks. The **Protocol** is the only part of the system that runs on-chain.

## Tools
This refers to a set of software that operates centrally, hosted on servers managed by the company providing the **Protocol** service. These systems can be replaced by alternatives developed either by third parties or by the community itself.

## Identity 
This is a unique entry record saved within the protocol, representing a business entity, whether a [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional) or a [**Contractor**](/the-protocol/roles/#contractor). This is after a process of KYC (Know Your Client) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) checks. Each [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional) and [**Contractor**](/the-protocol/roles/#contractor) can only have a single Identity within the system. The Identity is linked to a legally recognized document in the country where the company document is registered. Individuals cannot establish Identities within the protocol.

## Wallet
This is the public address of a wallet on the blockchain of one of the networks used by the Protocol. A single Identity can have multiple Wallets linked to its record.

## Treasury
This is the community wallet where funds related to the Community Fee are directed.
