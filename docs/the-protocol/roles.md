# Protocol Roles

## Community
The community constitutes an organization that brings together Professionals, usually within the same area of expertise. It provides a myriad of benefits to its members and also offers recruitment and selection services for **Contractors** looking to recruit community members.

## Member
A Member is an individual of legal age who has the legal capacity to provide services to others, and is an integral part of the community.

## Professional
A Professional is typically a sole proprietorship providing services performed by a [**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) Member. For Members who wish to use the protocol, having such a company is essential. To use the protocol, **Professionals** must have an established Identity.

## Contractor
A Contractor represents a business that requires services from Professionals and uses the Community to find and hire those professionals. Like Professionals, Contractors also need to have an established Identity to use the protocol.
