# Protocol Definitions

## Community Fee
Percentage of the value of the services provided by the Professional that is retained for the **Treasury** so that the [**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) can use it for the benefit of all **Members**.

## Community Token
Cryptocurrency that is given to the [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional) with each [**Payment**](/the-protocol/definitions/#payment) received and can be used as a gateway to access certain areas or services provided to the community or can be used as a governance token if the community has an interest in becoming a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

## Contract
Service provision relationship between the Professional and the Contractor. When using the protocol, one of the two creates the [**Contract**](/the-protocol/definitions/#contract) so that payments can be made from there.

## Skill
Record of a skill or knowledge required by the provision of the service that is associated with the [**Contract**](/the-protocol/definitions/#contract). This record will have a number associated with it that will represent the total financial amount received by Contracts that required a certain Skill. Badges will be created from the Skills.

## Invoice
Commercial document that records the details of a Payment related to the Contract established between the Contractor and the Professional. The invoice includes the value of the services performed, the Community Fee, the description of the services, the associated Skills, and the payment information.

## Payment
Transfer made by the [**Contractor**](/the-protocol/roles/#contractor) to the **Protocol** for the payment of an Invoice. The Protocol takes care of making the split, transferring the value of the [**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) Fee to the Treasury, the Protocol Fee to the Protocol's wallet, and the remainder to the [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional). In addition to transferring the **Community Tokens** to the [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional).

## Badges
Proof of experience that the Professional can mint in the form of an NFT that has the record of the Skills and their indices. The Badge is only a way to prove the Skills.
