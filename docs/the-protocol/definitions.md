# Protocol Definitions

## Community Fee
This is a percentage of the value of the services provided by the Professional, which is retained for the **Treasury**. The fee collected is used for the collective benefit of all [**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) members.

## Community Token
This is a form of cryptocurrency rewarded to the [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional) with each received payment. It serves as an access key to certain areas or services provided to the community, or alternatively, it can be used as a governance token if the community intends to eventually become a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

## Contract
This defines the service provision relationship between the Professional and the Contractor. Within the protocol, either party can establish a [**Contract**](/the-protocol/definitions/#contract), which then facilitates payment processing.

## Skill
Refers to the record of a specific skill or knowledge required to provide the service associated with the [**Contract**](/the-protocol/definitions/#contract). Each skill record will have a corresponding financial total associated with it, representing the total monetary amount received from Contracts that required a certain skill. Badges are subsequently created based on these skills.

## Invoice
This commercial document details a payment related to the Contract established between the Contractor and the Professional. An invoice includes the value of the services provided, the Community Fee, a description of the services, associated skills, and payment information.

## Payment
This denotes the transfer made by the [**Contractor**](/the-protocol/roles/#contractor) to the **Protocol** for the payment of an invoice. The Protocol is responsible for managing the split, transferring the value of the [**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) Fee to the Treasury, the Protocol Fee to the Protocol's wallet, and the remainder to the [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional). In addition to this, **Community Tokens** are transferred to the [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional).

## Badges
These serve as Proof of Experience that can be minted by the Professional in the form of an NFT, which records the skills and their indices. Badges primarily act as a means to verify these skills.
