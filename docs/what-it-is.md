# What It Is

The **Community Protocol** is a protocol focused on the relationship between communities, employers, and professionals.

The protocol offers a software infrastructure that solves companies' problem in hiring professionals, generates benefits and proof of experience for the hired professionals, and enables a sustainable business model for communities.

Everything is done through the processing of payments made by the company for the work performed by the professionals hired in the community.

The protocol functions as a payment gateway that distributes the money received, issues and distributes tokens that represent community benefits to the professional, and records the skills of the professionals involved in providing service as proof of their resume.
