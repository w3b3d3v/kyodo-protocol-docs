# What It Is

The **Kyōdō Protocol** is an innovative system that strengthens the connections between communities, businesses, and professionals. 

It provides a software infrastructure that addresses the challenges companies face in hiring professionals, delivers tangible benefits and proof of work experience to these professionals, and establishes a viable business model for the communities involved.

This is done by processing payments that companies make for services provided by community professionals.

In essence, the protocol acts as a payment gateway that effectively distributes received funds, issues and allocates tokens that symbolize community benefits to the professional, and documents the specific skills employed by professionals in providing services as a verifiable career history.
