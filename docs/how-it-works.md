# How It Works

[**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) leaders decide to implement the Protocol so that all members can benefit and the [**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) has a source of revenue. Initially, the leaders determine the [**Community Fee**](/the-protocol/definitions/#community-fee) , a percentage that will be charged on the amount of all services provided by participating members. This decision can be delegated to the members later on. Additionally, the **Community Token** will be minted, a unique token that will be distributed to participating members. This token can be used in gamification mechanisms or community governance, at the discretion of each one.

From this moment on, community members can use the tool and the protocol to receive compensation for all services rendered to their clients. The use of the protocol is not mandatory. The protocol provides a contract management and billing tool for the member to use.

To participate in the protocol, the member will need to go through a KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) process and create a verified account. In this account, the member will register their crypto wallets from the networks supported by the Protocol.

The member then registers a [**Contract**](/the-protocol/definitions/#contract) in the protocol that represents the service provision they negotiated with a client. This [**Contract**](/the-protocol/definitions/#contract) will reference the [**Contractor**](/the-protocol/roles/#contractor) , the description of the services, the agreed amount, the type of payment (single, installment, or recurring) and the Skills involved in this service provision, with a weight for each [**Skill**](/the-protocol/definitions/#skill). For example, if it is a contract to be a backend software developer in the Javascript language, they will be able to choose the Javascript skill with a weight of 100%, or they can choose two or more skills (e.g.: Javascript and Node.js), giving a weight of 50% for each one. All this information will be useful for the hiring process and future work and will be explained further below.

After having an active contract, approved by the company to execute the service, when billing their services to the hiring company, the member issues an invoice against their client from the **Billing Tool**.

The invoice includes the charge for the services performed and the community fee. Suppose the [**Community Fee**](/the-protocol/definitions/#community-fee) is 5%, then a salary of $10,000 will generate an invoice for $10,500 for the company to pay. That's $10,000 for the Professional and $500 for the Community.

In the description of the services, the **Skills** defined by the member will be highlighted so that the company can validate and confirm that the skills are really present in the service delivery.

The payment data will inform the payment address in cryptocurrencies on the network chosen by the member at the time of invoice issuance. The network to be used is an agreement between the professional and the hiring company. The payment must necessarily be made in cryptocurrencies because of the benefits generated for the [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional) and the [**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) , which will be explained below.

Upon receiving the invoice, the company makes the Payment to the informed address, an address generated by the **Protocol** that will process the [**Payment**](/the-protocol/definitions/#payment).

Upon receiving a [**Payment**](/the-protocol/definitions/#payment) , the **Protocol** will automatically know who the money comes from, under which Contract this payment is relative, who is the hired Professional, and under which Community this contract is being governed.

Immediately upon receiving the money, the protocol will then split the payment:

1. Transfer the value of the community percentage to the treasury, which in general will be a multi-sign wallet
2. Pay for the use of the protocol by transferring 0.5% to the protocol treasury
3. Transfer the remainder to the member who performed the service
4. Compute the amount of money received distributed by the Skills according to their weight in the Contract. For example, if the contract has two skills with a weight of 50% each, and the payment was $10K, each skill will have a nominal index of 5k.
5. Distribute 50% of the received nominal value in Community Tokens. For example, if the payment is $10,000, 5,000 community tokens will be sent to the member.

The Skills Index record will be used by the member as a resume proof. At any time, the professional can prove that they worked effectively with certain technologies, tools, or processes because this proof is related to how much money they actually received for performing a service. The higher the index, the longer the professional has worked with that skill or the more senior they are, considering that seniority is directly related to the price that the professional can charge in the market. Ultimately, the more money received, the more experience the person has.

The member can mint an NFT that will be updated with the weight of that Skill and the community can create a ranking of professionals by skills, which will make it easier for companies to find talents as they need them. This NFT is Soulbound, i.e., it cannot be transferred between Wallets. The community will have a revenue stored in its treasury because of the [**Community Fee**](/the-protocol/definitions/#community-fee) and can use the resources to offer benefits to its members, such as:

- Benefit club with discounts at establishments of interest to the community
- Active search for hiring companies to be customers hiring the members,
- Training, courses and free education for the entire community or for members participating in the protocol.

The community token can be used as an access gateway for certain areas or services provided to the community and/or be used as a governance token if the community is interested in becoming a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

In the case of a DAO, the member will be very interested in using the Protocol, because in addition to the benefits of the Community, the resume proof, they may also have ownership of the business with a vote on decisions related to the money received from the Community Fee generated with the work of other members. The more they work using the Protocol, the larger part of the business they will own and the "more owner" they will be of the DAO.

The DAO token may have liquidity in the secondary market and will appreciate as more Professionals join the community and choose to have their remunerations received through the Protocol, as this will represent more fees and greater value in the **Community Treasury**.
