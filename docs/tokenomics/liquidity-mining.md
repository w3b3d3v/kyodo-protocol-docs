# Liquidity Mining

A total of 6,000,000 KYD tokens will be distributed to those who provide liquidity to KYD, in future liquidity programs. This share of the total supply will be used as an incentive for liquidity providers, as a way to counterbalance impermanent loss caused by liquidity providing risks and volatility.

The more liquidity someone provides, and for longer, the greater share of the KYD pool they will receive. We have not decided yet what program will be used and in which DEXs we will launch a pool and create incentives for LPs.

We may use partners that provide active liquidity management, or incentive vaults that maximize fee collection and liquidity. This way, we will be integrated with other crypto projects that will market our LP pool for a broader audience. It is also beneficial as it removes pressure over the team in managing LP programs and lets them focus on building.
