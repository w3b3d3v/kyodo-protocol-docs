## $KYD Token Address

⚠️ The token has not yet been minted and is not listed on any exchange.

## Governance

KYD can also be seen as a Governance Token as it gives the right for token holders to vote on the decisions of the DAO, as well as make Signal and Core Proposals.

Keep in mind that the governance will be implemented gradually and in phases. In the beginning, all decisions will be made by the founders of Kyōdō Protocol, then they will be handled by the community.

1 KYD equals to 1 vote, so the more KYD the holder has, the more power over the DAO they will have. 

This includes power over the Treasury and the future of developments and integrations.
