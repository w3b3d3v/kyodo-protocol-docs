# Legal Disclaimers

You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with acquiring KYD tokens, holding KYD tokens, and using KYD tokens for participation in the Kyōdō DAO. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of KYD held. IF YOU DECIDE TO ACQUIRE KYD, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:

## Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
The regulatory status of KYD tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of virtual currencies has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including KYD tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact KYD in various ways. The issuer, the distributor(s) (or their respective affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, ma jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies, a cautious approach will be applied towards the distribution of KYD tokens. Therefore, for the token distribution, the distribution strategy may be constantly adjusted in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible.


## Inadequate disclosure of information
As of the date hereof, the Kyōdō DAO is still under development and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although this paper contains the most current information relating to the Kyōdō DAO, it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated from time to time. The KYD team has no ability and obligation to keep holders of KYD informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the development of the Kyōdō DAO, hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

## Competitors
Various types of decentralized applications and networks are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same or similar code and protocol underlying the Kyōdō DAO and attempt to recreate similar facilities. The Kyōdō DAO may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the KYD token.

## Loss of Talent
The development of the Kyōdō DAO greatly depends on the continued cooperation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect the Kyōdō DAO or its future development. Further, stability and cohesion within the team is critical to the overall development of the Kyōdō DAO. There is the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may occur, resulting in negative influence on the project in the future.

## Failure to develop
There is the risk that the development of the Kyōdō DAO will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or KYD tokens, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

## Security weaknesses
Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Kyōdō DAO in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the issuer, the distributor(s) or their respective affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Kyōdō DAO, which could negatively affect KYD. Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to KYD by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.

## Other risks
In addition, the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there are other risks that the issuer, its affiliates or parent, or the distributor(s) cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the issuer, its affiliates or parent, the distributor(s), and the Kyōdō team, as well as understand the overall framework, mission and vision for the Kyōdō DAO prior to acquiring KYD tokens.
