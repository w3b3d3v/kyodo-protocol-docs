# DAO Treasury

20% of the supply of the KYD token will be held by the DAO Treasury. At time zero, this means that it will hold 10,000,000 KYD. This treasury will keep expanding, as long as new fees are collected.

The community will decide strategically what to do with the Treasury in the Kyōdō DAO by vote, including partnerships, liquidity programs, and more.
