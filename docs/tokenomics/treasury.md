# DAO Treasury

DAO Treasury will hold 20% of the total supply of KYD tokens, which initially amounts to 10 million KYD. Treasury holdings will continue to grow over time as new fees are collected.

Strategic decisions regarding the use of the DAO Treasury, including establishing partnerships, launching liquidity programs, and more, will be made by the Kyōdō DAO community through a voting process.
