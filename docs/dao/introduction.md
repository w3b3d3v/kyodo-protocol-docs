# Introduction

Kyōdō DAO serves as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) committed to promoting the growth and development of the Kyōdō Protocol as a viable business. The Kyōdō DAO provides an open platform for [KYD](/tokenomics/token) token holders to submit and vote on various proposals.

Possible proposals may include:

* Building collaborative partnerships
* Addressing aspects related to protocol development
* Project-based investment prospects
* Suggesting changes to tokenomics

## Vision

We envision a world with self-sustaining communities that generate substantial value and benefits for their members.

## Mission

Our mission is threefold: empower communities with robust business models, help professionals land their dream jobs, and enable companies to efficiently attract top talent.

## Principles

* Kyōdō DAO differs from conventional corporate structures. It does not have a standard management team or workforce. Rather, it is an [entity](/dao/entity) of KYD token holders.
* Kyōdō DAO's [governance](/dao/governance) is based on a democratic model, with each member being able to propose possible partnerships, potential investments, and improvements in product development. The acceptance or rejection of these proposals is also determined by the vote of the members.
* While Kyōdō DAO operates independently, it does utilize a [service provider](/dao/service-provider) to manage various administrative tasks.

*This documentation has been inspired and modeled on [BitDAO docs](https://docs.bitdao.io).*
