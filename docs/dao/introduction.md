Possible proposals include:

### Mission

To support communities to maintain a healthy business model, professionals to work in their dream jobs and companies to hire the best people at reasonable time.

### Principles

* Kyōdō DAO is [governed](/dao/governance) by its members. Any member can propose partnerships, investments, or product development. Members will vote on whether to approve or reject these proposals.
* Kyōdō DAO will rely on a [service provider](/dao/service-provider) to facilitate various administrative functions.
