# Legal Entity

## The Kyōdō DAO LLC

The Kyōdō DAO will be represented in the real world by a Republic of the Marshall Islands for-profit DAO LLC.

## The importance to have a legal entity

Having a legal entity that represents the DAO in the "real world" is valuable for a number of reasons:

* It provides limited liability to DAO members for the actions of the DAO. Without a legal entity, members may be individually held liable for anything the DAO as a whole does.
* It is capable of complying with taxation requirements - without a legal entity, DAO members may be held liable for a proportion of the DAO's income, even if they are not able to access these funds.
* It is capable of entering into contracts with other "real world" entities, holding assets (including IP rights), and so forth.

For a more detailed discussion on this topic, see [this excellent blog post](https://mirror.xyz/0x954888B7a5C6736F4955dF18B556D8328FD02f61/5K9llACK4tzu5WHL68CM3bBsmSleL\_XxJ2kRGYnwp7A).

## RMI DAO LLC as a Solution

Like a typical company, the LLC has legal personality to enter into contracts and undertake actions with third parties. It is also managed by directors who carry on the business of the DAO. However, unlike a company, the RMI DAO LLC can be structured without shareholders.

In essence, it can be ownerless – just like the DAO it represents. In place of shareholders, the DAO can be supervised by a supervisor (or even multiple supervisors if desired).

A supervisor has no ownership or economic entitlement over the foundation company but simply acts as a steward, ensuring that the directors of the foundation company observe their obligations to the DAO in the terms of the foundation company's governing documents. Therefore, with no shareholders, all of the officers from the foundation company simply have the objectives of the DAO as their priority – similar to trustees and enforcers carrying out the objectives of a trust.

## Benefits of RMI DAO LLC

* No trustees, directors, officers, or managers with extra liability or responsibility
* All documents and records can be kept on the blockchain
* Most members can remain anonymous
* Governance by smart contract allowed by law

## Relationship with the United States
The RMI is a sovereign nation not
under US jurisdiction. Many of its
laws, such as its corporate laws, are
based on the laws of Delaware. RMI
courts will even look to case law in
Delaware if no statute or case law
exists on a matter in the RMI.

## Digital Asset Regulations
Currently, there are no digital asset,
token, or protocol-related laws or
regulations in the RMI, except for
companies that engage in the
custody of digital assets on behalf of
others. The plan is to introduce
innovative, tech-forward legislation
and regulation over time that applies
to digital assets, tokens, and
protocols.

## Why the Marshall Islands?
The Republic of the Marshall Islands
(RMI) has been a global leader in
shipping company jurisdictions for
over five decades. Over 40 public
companies traded on NASDAQ and
NYSE and companies representing
over 20% of the world's shipping
capacity are incorporated in the RMI.
Now, the RMI is applying what it has
learned in shipping to become the
leading global jurisdiction for DAOs.

## Compliance
The RMI is dedicated to following
international standards regarding
topics such as beneficial ownership.
DAO members with 25%+
governance rights in DAO LLCs and
any Managing Members must
complete KYC, providing their real
name, address, and passport.
Additionally, on-chain activity will be
monitored for Anti-Money Laundering
(AML) and Countering the Financing
of Terrorism (CFT). The RMI is proud
not to be part of any blacklists.

## Taxes
For-profit DAO LLCs will be subject
to the 3% Gross Revenue Tax (GRT)
on their earned revenue. This
includes interest payments but does
not include capital gains and
dividends. For-profit DAO members
may be subject to additional taxes by
their local jurisdictions.
