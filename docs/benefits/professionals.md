### Benefits For Professionals

The [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional) has many advantages in choosing to receive their remuneration through the **Protocol**. The person gains benefits offered by the community and in the case of DAOs, also gains business ownership. The idea is that the [**Community**](/the-protocol/roles/#community) Fee is lower than the fees employed by market gateways, so it will be a negotiation with few barriers for the Professional to have their [**Contractor**](/the-protocol/roles/#contractor) pay through the **Protocol**.

- Access to community benefits;
- Proof of Resume;
- Skill badges, weighted based on the financial value received;
- Use of a robust billing tool;
- In the case of DAOs:
  - Stake in community ownership;
  - Governance over Treasury holding Community Fees (equivalent to owning a share of PayPal).
