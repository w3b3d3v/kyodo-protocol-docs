### Benefits For Professionals

The **Professional** has many advantages in choosing to receive their remuneration through the **Protocol**. The person gains benefits offered by the community and in the case of DAOs, also gains business ownership. The idea is that the **Community** Fee is lower than the fees employed by market gateways, so it will be a negotiation with few barriers for the Professional to have their **Contractor** pay through the **Protocol**.

- Community benefits
- Proof of resume
- Badges of their skills with weight based on the financial value received
- Billing tool
- In the case of DAOs:
  - Community ownership
  - Governance over the Treasury that holds the Community Fees (it's like being the owner of PayPal)
