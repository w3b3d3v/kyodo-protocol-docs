# Introduction

Freelancers, independent entrepreneurs and job seekers often face difficulties in locating quality job opportunities and validating their experience and work history in the job market.

The conventional resume is no longer an effective tool.

The era of companies keeping static profiles of each potential candidate is over.

Companies, for their part, often struggle to confirm that potential hires actually have the necessary skills and the relevance of their previous work experiences.

In addition to the resume issue, there is also the challenge in the matchmaking between companies and professionals. Often, the ideal person does not appear on a company's radar, and companies end up taking a long time to find the necessary professionals within the desired timeframe.

In sectors such as software development, where the demand for professionals significantly exceeds the supply, this problem is intensified.

Communities present a potential solution to this issue.

A community is a collective of individuals with shared interests, objectives, values, or geographical areas. They interact and cooperate, establishing social bonds and forming a communal identity. Communities provide a sense of belonging, mutual assistance, and a platform where members can engage and actively participate.

For companies looking for talented professionals, communities can be a goldmine. They bring together a multitude of professionals from the same field, streamlining the search for the right candidate. For professionals, communities offer knowledge, education, a platform for discussion and exchange of ideas, and opportunities for personal and professional development. They can also serve as a source of employment.

Communities are usually founded by passionate professionals who devote their time to their interests, seeking financial rewards, social acknowledgment and reputation.

However, these professionals do not always consider a viable business model that can financially support community activities and generate sufficient incentives to keep members active. Creating and maintaining a business model for communities is a huge challenge.

Within this scenario of contracting companies, professionals and communities, the **Kyōdō Protocol** solution emerges.
