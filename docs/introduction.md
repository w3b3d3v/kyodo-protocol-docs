# Introduction

Freelance professionals, solo entrepreneurs, and job applicants often struggle to find clients and quality job opportunities and often have trouble proving their knowledge and experience in the market.

The traditional resume is already an obsolete tool.

Gone are the days when companies stored static documents with the profile of each candidate.

Companies, in turn, struggle to verify whether candidates truly possess the necessary skills and how relevant their previous work experiences were.

Beyond the issue of the resume, we also notice a challenge in matchmaking between companies and professionals. Often, the ideal person does not appear on a company's radar, and companies end up taking a long time to find the professional they need in the timeframe they require.

In sectors such as software development, where the demand for professionals is much higher than the supply of talent, the problem worsens.

A solution to this problem is communities.

A community is a group of people who share similar interests, values, goals, or geographic locations. They interact and collaborate with each other, creating social bonds and establishing a collective identity. The community provides a sense of belonging, mutual support, and an environment where individuals can engage and actively participate.

Communities represent oases of professionals for companies wishing to find talent. They bring together many professionals from the same field, making it easier to search for the right professional. For professionals, communities offer knowledge, education, a space for exchange, and personal and professional growth. They are also a channel for finding work.

Communities are generally created by enthusiastic professionals who dedicate their time to their passion and are looking for financial return, social recognition, and reputation.

However, these professionals do not always consider a viable business model that can financially support the community's activities and generate enough incentives to keep members active. Creating and maintaining a business model for communities is a massive challenge.

Within this scenario of hiring companies, professionals, and communities, the solution **Kyōdō Protocol** emerges.
