# Concepts

## Protocol
Set of software that runs in a decentralized way through smart contracts on supported networks. The **Protocol** is only the part of the system that runs on-chain.

## Tools
Set of software that runs centrally on servers hosted by the company that provides the **Protocol** service. These systems can be replaced by any other developed by third parties or by the community itself.

## Identity
A unique record that is saved in the protocol and represents a company, whether it's a [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional) or a [**Contractor**](/the-protocol/roles/#contractor) , after undergoing a process of KYC (Know Your Client) and AML (Anti Money Laundering). Each [**Professional**](/the-protocol/roles/#professional) and [**Contractor**](/the-protocol/roles/#contractor) can have only one Identity in the system. The Identity is associated with some document of legal value in the country where the company's document is registered. Natural persons cannot create Identities in the protocol.

## Wallet
The public address of the wallet on the blockchain of one of the networks used by the Protocol. An Identity can have multiple Wallets associated with its registration.

## Treasury
The community's wallet where the money related to the Community Fee goes.
